# TentaCool
*design by sillisam71  
idea by MirageC*


## What if we are using CPAP turbine wrong?
I mean this thing is capable of decent pressure levels while still moving great amount of air...
And yet we are designing ducts with as little restriction as possible in order to get the maximum flow to the output nozzles.  

## Hypothesis:
Would an hybrid between berdair and regular ducting be something that would be better suited for that monster turbine?  More turbulent flow, more output holes and diffusers... see my point...   
What if we could create a carpet of turbulent air around the last layer?
